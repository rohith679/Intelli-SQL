  ```
  # .streamlit/secrets.toml
  API_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key"
  ```

- Or set it in your environment:

## Usage

1. **Upload your SQLite database** (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`).

   - "Show all students who scored above 90."
   - "How many orders were placed in 2023?"
   - "List unique product categories."
4. **See the generated SQL and results.**
5. **Download results as CSV** if needed.
6. **Try the sample database** if you don't have one.
